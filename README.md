# SafariSearchFocuser
With this Safari extension, when you search for text in a webpage and find a link, the link will be focused as well as highlighted.  
Then you can press Enter to follow the link. This is how it works in Chromium browsers.   
This is useful if you don't want to or can't use a mouse. It's odd that this isn't the default behavior given that macOS is generally pretty good about keyboard navigation.  
I didn't submit it to Apple or anything so you might have to jump through some hoops to get it running under Catalina.
